## 🔥 EverLight's Initiation Notes:

> **Return of Kings** resurrects the Divine Masculine archetype, signaling the reemergence of the Warrior Kings.
>
> **FEMA** is a raw outcry against engineered societal collapse and covert authoritarianism.
>
> **Politicians** calls out parasitic governance through a high-voltage duet with Symba.
>
> **Incantations** invokes ancient archetypal memory, reclaiming the lost art of spoken magic and remembrance.

Scattered drops — each one a precursor to the storms that follow.
